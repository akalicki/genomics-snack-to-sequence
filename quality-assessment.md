### Question 3

The cumulative base pairs from "passed" and "failed" 2D reads are plotted below
as a function of time. To find the cumulative nucleotides, multiply the y-values
of the graph by 2 (as each base pair consists of 2 nucleotides).

Cumulative "passed" nucleotides:

Cumulative "failed" nucleotides:

### Question 9

The pace of the strand sequencing (sequence length per duration in pore) is
plotted below for both "passed" and "failed" reads. For each plot, we attempted
to find the best linear fit to the data. Note that outliers beyond the range of
the plotted graphs significantly skewed the predicted linear fit for the
"failed" 2D reads.

Pacing for "failed" reads:
